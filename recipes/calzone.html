        <p>The calzone is a specialty of Italian cuisine made in a similar way to pizza but completely closed by<br> a dough; it can be stuffed with cheese, meat, vegetables or other condiments, and is cooked in the oven.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <em>Calzone Dough:</em>
            <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup water, lukewarm</li> 
            <li>1 tsp white sugar</li>    
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <br><em>Filling Ingredients: </em>
            <li>½ cup diced sausage</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced pepperoni</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup Parmesan</li>
            <li>1/2 cup spinach</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp basil leaves</li>
            <li>egg wash, 1 egg + 1 tbsp water</li>
            marinara sauce, for dipping</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the calzone dough, in a large bowl, combine yeast and sugar in lukewarm water. Wait a few <br>seconds until the yeast dissolves. Then add salt and gradually stir in flour, mix with your hands until <br>dough is smooth. Then transfer the dough to a large cutting board sprinkled with flour. Knead the <br>dough for about 5 minutes or until elastic. Place the dough in a large bowl coated with oil, cover with <br>plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes or until the size doubles.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F and set aside a cooking sheet lined with parchment paper while you prepare<br> the filling.
            </li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook sausage pieces over medium-high heat. Crumble the sausage as you stir and <br> cook until no longer pink. Add pepperoni and vegetables. When cooked, remove from the skillet and <br> allow to cool. Add cheese and mix.
            </li>
            <li>When the dough has risen, roll it out the dough into a large rectangular shape on a lightly floured <br>surface. Divide into 4 pieces. Spoon the meat, cheese and vegetable mixture on one side of each <br>rectangle. Fold the dough and pinch edges to seal completely. Place them on the baking sheet and <br>brush the surface of each calzone with egg wash. Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>Serve warm with Marinara Sauce.
