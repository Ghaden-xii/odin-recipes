        <h2>Classic italian Lasagna with ricotta cheese, layered with<br> noodles, a hearty meat sauce and two different kinds of <br>cheese. A tasty comfort food recipe, this Lasagna is perfect<br> for a cold winter night or Sunday dinner with the family.</h2>
        <p>The term 'lagana', already in use in Roman times, referred to square- or rectangular-shaped thin<br> sheets obtained from a mixture of wheat flour, then baked or fire-cooked.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cans (14.5 ounce) whole tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried basil</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>3 c. low fat cottage cheese</li>
            <li>2 whole beaten eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 c. grated (not shredded) Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 package (10 ounce) lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook <br>over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if youâ€™re feeling naughty.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are<br> working on the other steps.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons<br> parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and<br> the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until 'al dente'<br> (not overly cooked). Drain. </li>
            <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping<br> if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover<br> cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the<br> meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top<br> generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 <br>to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
