        <h2>A delicious light dinner composed of sliced tomatoes, fresh <br> mozzarella, and basil, sprinkled with salt and drizzled with<br> olive oil that goes well with some roasted potatoes or a<br> salad. If you are looking for a new way to enjoy chicken <br> then give this a try.</h2> 
        <p>The Caprese salad is a classic Italian dish. <br>You might notice that the three main ingredients are the colors of the Italian flag. The red of the tomato, the green of the basil, and the white <br>of the cheese are meant to represent the flag of Italy. Not only do these ingredients represent the colors of Italy, but they are traditional food <br> products of Italy as well.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <em></em>
            <li>20 ounces skinless boneless chicken breast, trimmed of visible fat (about 3 breasts)</li>
            <li>1 quart homemade or store-bought low sodium chicken broth</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup lightly packed basil leaves, torn</li>    
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon zest from 1 lemon</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound rigatoni or other sturdy tubular pasta</li>
            <li>1 quart cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>12 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup lightly packed basil leaves, rough chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts in saucepan with chicken broth, basil, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, peppercorns, and zest. If needed, add water to just <br> cover chicken. Heat over medium heat until broth comes to simmer. Reduce heat to low and gently simmer until chicken reads 155Â°F on instant read thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Place chicken on cutting board and when cool enough to handle, use 2 forks to shred chicken into chunky bite size pieces. Return chicken to broth off heat until ready to use.</li>
            <li>In medium bowl, slowly whisk olive oil into balsamic vinegar until combined. Add red pepper flakes, season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta in salted water according to package directions. Drain. Using slotted spoon, remove chicken from broth. Reserve broth for another use.</li>
            <li>Return pasta to pot and toss with chicken, tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.</li>
