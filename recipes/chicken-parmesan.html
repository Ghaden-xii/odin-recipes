        <h2>'Chicken parmigiana' is a popular dish consisting of breadcrumbs-coated chicken breasts that are topped with tomato sauce and cheese, then baked until the cheese melts and the chicken is properly cooked.</h2>
        <p>Although it has an Italian-sounding name, chicken parmigiana is actually an American dish, derived from an Italian dish called melanzana alla parmigiana, or eggplant parmigiana.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Eggs, for the egg wash</li>
            <li>Flour, salt, and pepper to dredge</li>
            <li>Italian bread crumbs and parmesan for the crust</li>
            <li>A good cooking oil</li>
            <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
            <li>Shredded Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Parsley or basil to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the easy 20-minute homemade marinara and while it simmers, continue to prepare the chicken.</li>
            <li>Cut 2 chicken breasts in half length-wise for 4 cutlets and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Set up 3 shallow bowls: In the first bowl, combine flour, salt and pepper, in the second bowl, beat together 2 eggs and in the third bowl, stir together parmesan and bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Dredge chicken in flour, dusting off excess, then dip in eggs and turn to coat in bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Once all chicken is breaded, heat a large non-stick skillet with enough oil to lightly coat the bottom and saute 3-4 minutes per side or until just cooked through at 165˚F on an instant-read thermometer.</li>
            <li>Pour half of your marinara sauce in a casserole dish. Arrange chicken pieces over marinara in a single layer. Spoon on marinara sauce and top with cheese then bake in a casserole dish at 425˚F for 15 minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling.</li>
